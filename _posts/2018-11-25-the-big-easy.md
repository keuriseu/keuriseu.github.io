And we're back ready for the final stretch. It's gonna be crazy you better believe it. I have to be in my A game for recruiting. When this is done, it would really feel like the Big Easy.

So New Orleans was great! Food was amazing, the history, the music, the architecture exquisite. It was fun travelling with the Maeda family and I would love to have more future trips with them. We learned about Hurricane Katrina which was devastating beyond words. I saw an NBA game at a great price, you can't beat that. 

So we were back in Evanston and Paul and Hill hosted a Thanksgiving dinner. It was just great. We need to really be in the spirit of Thanksgiving. It now excites me just thinking about this year's Christmas, although it might be mellow. I haven't been in a country that celebrates Christmas the way it was meant to be celebrated in a long time.

Ed and Jess visited and they are just so nice. We owe them a lot and we heard an awesome news. Sean will have new friends very soon. Excited to travel with other families.

Now, time to get a job.

But first, PHOTO DUMP!
