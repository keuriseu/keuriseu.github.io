Staring at a blank page before you. Today is where your book begins, the rest is still unwritten. I've been reading this great book called How to Win Friends and Influence People. I'm just in the middle but I hope I can actually learn and live its teachings.

So MBA has not been the how I imagined it, a perfect place. Far from perfect, I am raw, awkward and uncomfortable. But only one quarter has passed. The best is yet to come.

My queen is the most important person in my life and I shall do my best and make her feel like one. Actions speak louder than words. I realize my faults and I am accountable for the disappointments and displeasures. It's not too late to change.
