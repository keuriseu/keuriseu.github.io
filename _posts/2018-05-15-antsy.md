It feels realer by the moment. The once small possibility that I would be able to change my job function and industry to consulting just seems real. At this point, I am just waiting for the start of the program, which is still two months away.

## Time to be superhuman

I'm taking the plunge into a course I bought months ago. I have some time before I get bogged down with the MBA life so I'll make it a goal to finish this. I have to do some multi-tasking while taking care of the baby too. But don't forget that I have to keep the push up and shuffle challenges alive.

Terms to keep in mind [Progressive Overload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_overload) and [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).

## Killing Strategy

This article is helpful in providing current and insightful views on Management Consulting. Showing in-depth knowledge about the industry would be advantageous during interviews.

[Killing Strategy: The Disruption Of Management Consulting](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/disrupting-management-consulting/)

Takeaways:
* Before Bruce Doolin Henderson opened the doors of Boston Consulting Group on July 1, 1963, the concept of “competition” barely existed in American business culture, let alone the concept of strategy.
* Information
These are more difficult to get going at scale, but they’re not highly advanced from a technological point of view — meaning the data collection aspect is not what’s differentiating the Bain offering in this case.
What’s truly differentiating Bain’s offering in this case (and the management consulting offering in cases more generally) is the expertise that the consultant brings to the situation.
* Expertise
McKinsey had always practiced the situational, “it depends” style of management consulting. Gluck wanted to change that and build a culture of expertise inside the firm.
But outside those fields, the expertise function of consulting has been largely unbundled. Today, the same types of experts that big consultancies have hired for decades can be consulted independently, without needing to pay for the rest of the management consulting package, thanks to so-called “learning networks.”
Over time, GLG found that its investor clients were much more interested in having casual, one-off chats with its experts than in reading its reports. The fund managers GLG talked to, according to the New York Times, said “many of their best insights came through casual conversations, not from formal reports.”
* Insights
As Clayton Christensen writes in the Harvard Business Review, the most prestigious management consulting firms today operate like a black box. Companies bring them a problem, and they produce a solution. Visibility into what happens during that process is highly limited.
Clients judge whether or not the solution will be good based on indirect signals: the consulting firm’s brand and prestige, the specific domain of knowledge required to solve the problem, and the company’s prior experience with that firm and consultants in general.
The frameworks developed by big management consultancies may be public knowledge. The consultants who implemented those insights may be on the job market. But that does not replace the utility of consultancies when it comes to new and emergent issues.
Consulting firms are tasked with looking ahead to figure out what major development will matter to their clients next. That’s the only way they can stay alive, which has been true ever since BCG’s designed its growth-share matrix to help 1960s conglomerates regain their sense of focus.
* Execution
But today, there’s often a much wider gap between idea and execution. “Build a multi-platform analytics stack so you can predict how your users’ demand will change dynamically in the future” isn’t the kind of plan that you can simply execute on without expertise.
As the management consulting firms handle this new world, they’re doing less and less outright strategy work and more and more work on execution.

Similarly, consulting and strategy teams could be increasingly brought in-house, rather than hired externally.
As Clay Christensen points out in the Harvard Business Review, the inside counsel model is made possible by the fact that general counsels and their staff today have access to powerful legal workflow and on-demand staffing tools like Axiom. They can get customized support from networks like AdvanceLaw. And they can outsource more basic tasks like “large-scale document and data review” to firms like LeClairRyan, which run leaner and cheaper than a conventional law firm.
