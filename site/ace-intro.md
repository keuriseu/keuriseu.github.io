# Toastmaster

## Intro

How many here are familiar with Toastmasters?
*React*
For those unfamiliar, Toastmasters is a public speaking club which I first heard of many years ago but I just actually joined 2 years ago.
So let me tell you my story.

## The Problem

"I get nervous when I am on stage." I have been saying that all my life but people always say: Everyone gets nervous. Everyone is afraid.

But I knew I was different. If I am nervous, trust me, you'll know. How? My heart starts pounding really hard dug-dug, dug-dug. Sometimes it will be running fast, dug-dug-dug-dug-dug-dug like someone is running after me. And these things I cannot control. and even worse and most embarassing of all, my hands start shaking. There were countless embarassing times when I was on stage, holding a piece of paper, shaking like crazy. 

Yes people get nervous, but in my case I cannot hide it.

## The Solution

I joined this club after a long time of avoiding. I mean, how could I? I'm scared of public speaking and now I will join a club where public speaking is all you do? You've got to be kidding me.

But yes I did. To cut a long story short, I joined. Very slowly I improved, became aware of my tendencies. In the end, after every week of getting speaking opportunities in front of the club, I gained confidence.

The heart throbbing went away just because of familiarity of something that I do every week and knowing that there is nothing to be afraid of. The hand shaking, is much less now but I try to avoid holding notes on my hand.

Now I am by no means a confident speaker but I am happy with where I am now and I know I am still on the journey. 

This was a story of I faced a fear and the I'm happy with the realization that there is nothing I am horrible at that I won't improve.

Thank you
