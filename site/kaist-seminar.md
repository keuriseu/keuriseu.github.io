## The speech

I didn't rehearse my speech. I figured, it will be like a conversation and I am simply talking about my experiences. And it was a dialogue. The speech went well but I still have shaking hands and a bit of nervousness. I hope I didn't sound too negative about Samsung. This was the recency bias that was talking. After a few years it will all balance out and just the way I felt about KAIST today, I will feel about Samsung.

## Memory lane

KAIST is a beautiful university. Even more so now with new buildings and new funding. Visiting KAIST once again, seeing the dormitory, the buildings, surroundings, the old smells, it brought back great memories. I did have a wonderful time in KAIST. I needed this trip to remind myself of that. Somehow the simple, good times were not the ones the first memories I remember when I think of KAIST. Maybe I focus on negative ones. But it is clear. I have great memories with the school and it felt good coming back and sharing how my life has been to the students.

I met David and Sangwoo, the only remaining connection from 6 years ago. That felt really good. I wish I could have met Professor, who I am really thankful for, for taking a chance on me. People were saying he was very proud of me but if my memory serves me right, he wouldn't. Which is why I think I underestimate how my KAIST life turned out to be. I do regret that I didn't make the most of my time in KAIST, that is meeting more people and being more active in school events. Hindsight is 20-20, they say. I'll make the most of my next school experience.
