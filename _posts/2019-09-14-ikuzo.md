Year two, let's go! Full five credits, full on recruiting, responsibilities with clubs, growing kid. Let's get it on!

It is all going to be fine. Everything will fall into place give it two months.

Credit card problems. Stupid Apple Card and Goldman Sachs. Moving in struggles. When will we get a car?

It's hard to live without an income or at least a promise of one. Shit.
