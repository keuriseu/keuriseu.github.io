We won - elusive words that I have been longing to say for such a long time now. Basketball in Digital City has been my saving grace from the stresses at work. But unfortunately our team has been winless for the last two years. This year is my last and I will leave the team mid-season. It would have been depressing if I left without winning so this is a good start. This year is something to look forward to. The team added new key players who will surely improve our chances this season. 

The league now tracks stats which is pretty neat. Seeing your stats after the game gives that professional league feeling. I wish they have started this earlier.

## Flavor of the week

Finished Bates Motel Season 4 last week and here are my thoughts:
* Psychological thrillers are scariest. I like how Norman's and Norma's past logically explains why a psycho is the way he is. He is damaged. Norma protects him because that's what a mother does. 
* It's cool how the series evolved slowly until now it is at the point where the movie started.
