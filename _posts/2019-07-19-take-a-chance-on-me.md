Mid-summer evaluation. I don't have the executive presence. I don't create followers. Fair. But this hit me hard. I want to be a GM and I am at a disadvantage because I am quiet. It is not my strength. I am slow to implement. Fair. But can I really change something just like that? I need to bounce back. I like the Fortive culture and I have been seeing myself with the company since I started. I need to strive hard.

Do this for myself and don't be caught up with the pressure of getting an offer. I want to make an impact. I want to leave the place better than I found it. I am going to transform the product line to lean. I am going to improve the throughput by putting the structure in place.

Be a GM. Isapuso't isaisip. Show leadership. It is an important piece. Dealing with the process and the people part. I'll show you.

My Dad, the COO, the unexpected source of advice. Very cool. Talking your problem out really helps.
