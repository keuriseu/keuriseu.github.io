Thursday night, the doctor said it's still a long way and Sean seems like he doesn't want to come out just yet. We were now looking at some time next week. But then that night, Soyeon had a bloody show. Google said that it was not a sign that labor will start. We sleep and at a bit past midnight, Soyeon woke me up saying the her water broke. Once the water breaks, you need to go to the hospital, so off we go at 1 AM.

It's happening. Baby is officially on his way. I would work for 5 hours and then go the hospital as soon as possible. I tried to sleep for an hour at home but could not. Drove back to the hospital and went to work. Got out of work.
