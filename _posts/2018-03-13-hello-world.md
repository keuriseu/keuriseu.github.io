Blogging is one of the things I have always wanted to do but always didn't actually follow through. This is not the first attempt. There are a few of my lost blogs out there in cyberspace that had one or two posts in it and that's it. What makes this attempt different? Nothing, except that I have a feeling that this one will stick. A lot of life changes are lined up for me this year - first child, MBA, new city, new life. And a lot has happened during the past years that I feel regretful that I haven't done a good job documenting them. All that is done but there's a lot more to come. Life begins at thirty-one, I'll say. So here's to the upcoming events in my life. Sit back, write and enjoy.

Recent events of how I got here
* Turmoil for the first time in my Samsung career
* Coursera. Online courses.
* Inception of MBA. Kartheek getting into Cornell. Wanting to get out of Korea.
* The Toastmasters experience. Mentored by Sandy, who became a Tuckie. Speeches.
* GMAT journey. Essay writing.
* Dinners Jon and Jatin
* Rejected by HBS and GSB. Getting into Kellogg and Yale!
