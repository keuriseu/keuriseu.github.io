TMI. Information overload. Internship is great so far. Real work being done and even realer work will be done soon. I'm being a work junkie going to the office on weekends but there's nothing else for me to do and I feel like I can really make an impact with this project. It is tough really. Everyone is senior and it is foolish not to consider that they have thought about improvements I can think of. I have to leverage their knowledge.

I miss my family. Looking back I think this was a bad decision to live separately from them. On the other hand it is so tough to relocate a family to a new city especially if it is just temporary. I don't think I'll live separately from my family again.

I could see myself in Fortive. But is it my purpose? What is my vocation? That remains to be answered. I know that the growth opportunity in Fortive is supposed to be amazing. I'm excited for my second year. Now I feel all the new knowledge has been able to help me. The second year me will be wiser and smarter about the business world. I'm happy with my progress. Now, I just have to achieve my targets for this internship. Fix the mess I made with my passport. And get on with life.
