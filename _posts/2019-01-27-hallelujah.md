Thank you Fortive! That's a huge relief that I finally got an offer. Fortive is really suitable for my background and future goals. I'll be happy if I indeed be with them in the future. I'm waiting for MetLife now, feeling good about it. My last interview will be with Amazon. It will be the most challenging one yet.

Now I can relax for a bit and focus on my courses. I'm really digging operations. Robert Bray is cool but yeah, trying to max out efficiencies out of processes is really amazing.
