Regarding parenting, still learning the ropes. I think of Sean as little Cris.

## Big Brother

I am presenting in a few weeks about employment after graduation and working life as a foreign student. Going back to KAIST! I am eager to do this and I quickly grabbed this opportunity to go back and share about my story. Conducting a seminar is something I have never imagined, by the way, and is a first for me. But I am up to the challenge. My Toastmasters training will certainly help. It is time for me to get reflective. Quite timely that I will talk right before I will leave Korea, to move on the my next chapter.

## Flavor of the week
