It's a better week. We are getting acclimated to our house. There's so many good people to meet in Kellogg. We are just getting started.

Sean had his first fever and it was quite a scare. Doctors and nurses here are more engaging socially than in Korea - a welcome change. Although the visit took a lot more time. A tradeoff with efficiency.

On Sean's 4th month of life, he is 76th percentile in weight (7.5 kg), and 99th!!! percentile in height (27 in). The dream is alive!

It's gonna be tough being a parent in this schedule. These two years will be a balancing act. I hope it all works out in the end.

## Language and Prejudice

A question I have always had is the way African Americans say ask (aks). Who better to ask than a doctor in linguistics. Interestingly, people judge by the way someone speaks. An English accent is regarded as prestigious whereas the language African Americans use are regarded as wrong. Who is to say what is wrong or not? Who decides which way is the standard way of speaking English? Things are just the way they are.
