I just became a dad (yay!) but things are picking up slow. This must be the calm before the storm. In three weeks, we will take home Sean and deal with parenting ourselves. In a month, I will process our housing and visas. In two months, we're gonna sell the house and pack. The closer August gets, I'll be more anxious. Better for me to just enjoy the present and go with the flow.

## On Cuteness

Is it possible for a parent think his/her baby is ugly? I prepared myself to see an ugly baby since pictures of newborn babies I have seen do not look cute at all. But from the moment I saw my son come out of my wife, I was all smiles and just saw beauty. Was that bias? Maybe, maybe not, I'm just happy we have a cute healthy baby to look at.
