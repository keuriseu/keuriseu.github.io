Daily meetings have been going on for months now they are brutal.

As a seasoned waygook, I have been in countless meetings held in Korean. It is a handicap that I have learned to deal with. I thought that this problem will be over once I learned Korean. That I did, but was still not enough. I am a one-way communicator in Korean and it takes a whole new attitude to be able to actively engage in discussions.

This gives me hope when I finally move to the US. I imagine it would feel like spirit cuffs released [*cue epic soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WDPgh1nKdw).
