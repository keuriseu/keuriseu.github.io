It takes a lot of chutzpah to go against your fellow officers, against a popular opinion. I find myself in this position for the second time. I believe Indu should be treated fairly. I do not like that some people suddenly decide to run, or scheme, against Indu, who only wants to contribute to the growth of the club. It is not for me to decide that she should not take a major role. I appreciate Indu's chutzpah for running for the two highest positions in a club she is new in. She has no ill intentions and I believe her energy and skills will bring freshness that the club needs.

Flashback 10 years ago when I was fighting for Inez to be able to run. While it is true that we should follow the constitution, it became subject to further interpretation. I did not like that she was treated unfairly by giving varying levels of effort in the voting process.

## Meetings

Daily meetings are good when starting a new task in order to accelerate and boost the initial progress. It is good to use when the goals are not yet clear. However once longer term goals become clear, daily meetings are not anymore necessary. It takes a lot of time and adds unnecessary pressure for everyone. Continuing to do so burns out the personnel.
