I came across this [article](https://medium.com/the-mission/warren-buffetts-20-slot-rule-how-to-simplify-your-life-and-maximize-your-results-760e7109ffe8). From the Oracle of Omaha:

> I could improve your ultimate financial welfare by giving you a ticket with only 20 slots in it so that you had 20 punches — representing all the investments that you got to make in a lifetime. And once you’d punched through the card, you couldn’t make any more investments at all.

As the article says, it is not only applicable to financial investments, but to *time* investments as well.

> Your odds of success improve when you are forced to direct all of your energy and attention to fewer tasks.

Up until I reached thirty, I considered myself young, having enough time to explore, to discover myself. But times are changing and I am still not certain about my identity. Applying for MBA showed me the different opportunities and now it's time to narrow down. At the same time, I am looking to enter consulting for more exposure to different industries and find what I'm truly passionate about.

More realistically speaking, it would take a few more years to narrow down my focus and define my final form. And until then I will continue to change and evolve. All that being said, it will be good to remember that the period of *dipping my toes in the water* is over. It is time to practice persistence and go knee or waist deep.
