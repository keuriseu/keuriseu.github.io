Had my McKinsey interviews this week. The idea of working in the PH came up again. If I could work as a consultant for a year.. Would Fortive be up for it? What would I give up for having McKinsey in my resume.

I finally finished Big Data to Big Profits which was a suckily written book. Man I had to battle through it but I made it at the end. I finished it.

There's so many homeless in Portland. It smells. Portland would be really nice if not for the homeless problem. What it do baby? Also Kawhi and PG to the clippers. Subscribe.

Spider-Man Far From Home. Cool movie. Venice and Prague, take me back. Great memories.
