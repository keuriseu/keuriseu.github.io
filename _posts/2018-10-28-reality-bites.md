What's the backup plan? I don't have a serious one. I would only like to try consulting over the summer? But we won't know how it will turn out until next year. This looks like it will be a very long wait. In the meantime I should network my ass off and attend other company presentations along the way. Talk to second years and see what I can gather. It is hard being an international, really. When will this be over?

Final midterm exam tomorrow. Let's get it.
