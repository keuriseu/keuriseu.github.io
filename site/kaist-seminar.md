I. Introduction
* Introduce self through timeline

#### Disclaimer: what I will say is based on my experience which I hope reflects the real situation

II. Landscape
1. Is it easy to find a job?
..* Short answer no. Long answer - it depends on a lot of things.
.... Major. I can only speak for EE. I have friends from CS, Industrial, Chemical. Materials. We all found jobs, some faster than others.
.... Economic Situation. 2012 Samsung was in its peak in hiring success of S3. A few years later there was not a lot of hiring. A few years ago it recovered. It is not simple.
.... There are not a lot of opportunities for non-Korean speakers. There are a number of Korean conglomerates who hire regularly. There are are big foreign companies that have branches or offices here. There are small to medium sized startups that hire foreigners. Some of them target specific nationalities maybe they work or target those markets. But all in all that's not a lot. The good news is that you're from KAIST and you will be first in line to get those jobs.

III. 1st advice - Start early. Know your options and objectives.
..* I know you are busy. In my case in my last semester, I was busy with my thesis. I didn't even know if I was going to graduate. I was even thinking of PhD. In short, I didn't know what was going to happen next year and I had no clue what to do, where to apply, what are available, who's hiring. Do your homework from the beginning.
..* I missed my chance at LG. I didn't even know when.

IV. 2nd advice - Expect the worst. Keep applying. and don't waste your time.
..* Samsung interview twice.
..* Be resourceful. Use time wisely. I studied Korean. Now that I look back, I could have done a lot more using the 6 months that I was looking for a job. Take courses in Udemy, Coursera. Not related to your work, for personal development. Anything. Little did I know that I would never have that kind of time again after that. During that time I was so bored that I just wanted to work. And when I got to Samsung I was so overworked that I always wish I was back at that time when I was out of job.

V. 3rd advice - Learn Korean.
..* Why?
..* Increases chances by a lot. You wouldn't want to receive information second hand. After some time it gets old. At first it is fine.
..* Coworkers who didn't learn Korean
..* Damn hard. Share tips. Different learning styles.

VI. What was it like working for a Korean company?
..* Know the differences. Heard time and time again. Awareness and adaptability.
..* Why am I leaving? At some point I thought I would be retiring in Samsung.

VII. Conclusion
..* I am always grateful.

VIII. Questions



II. Recruitment Period
* Continue to PhD, Get a job in the industry
* 1st advice - decide early, envision what you want to do after graduation, know what are the options, companies that recruit
* Job fairs - regular every year, means you have to wait until the next one. Do not waste your time. Learn a new skill. Network. Small/Medium companies.
* Big companies - chaebol

III. My Samsung Story
* You must prepare as well as you can, but in reality it is matter of luck
* S3 time

IV. Korean Skills - A Must
* Globalization, they will tell you that everyone speaks English but reality is different

V. Working Life
* Know what you are getting yourself into.
* Be ready. Be competent. The fact that you are a foreigner is an asset but it is not enough.
* Do not live in a bubble.
