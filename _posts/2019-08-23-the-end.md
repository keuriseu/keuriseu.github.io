And so it is done. The internship is over. I had many incredible learnings and experiences. Will they extend me an offer? We'll see. Will it be the end of the world when I don't receive an offer? Of course not. But I surely would like to have one. Now I just want to go back to my family and spend time with them. Before that I will find out more about McKinsey. Is it for me? I doubt, but it is worth a look.

I'm here at the airport, tired and sleepy. It's been a long 10 weeks. Dating back before that actually. And we have one more year of this shit ahead of us. Good shit.

McKinsey is like a stamp that says you are good and you will be recruited heavily. I liked my experience. It will be worth a try. I hope I get the offer from Fortive and then I can leverage.
