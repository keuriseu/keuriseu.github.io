Regarding parenting, still learning the ropes. I think of Sean as little Cris. It really does get frustrating when you are doing something and the baby cries. There is something about a crying baby that messes with your system that you won't be able to do anything else. The black mirror episode where you can mute the sounds around you comes to mind.

## Win no. 2

It was the best game I played and it came with the W. I hit 4 straight shots and the defense focused on me. I made the right pass and the three went in. Game. Now how do I break it to the team that the next game is my last?

## Big Brother

I am presenting in a few weeks about employment after graduation and working life as a foreign student. Going back to KAIST! I am eager to do this and I quickly grabbed this opportunity to go back and share about my story. Conducting a seminar is something I have never imagined, by the way, and is a first for me. But I am up to the challenge. My Toastmasters training will certainly help. It is time for me to get reflective. Quite timely that I will talk right before I will leave Korea, to move on the my next chapter.

## Flavor of the week

Watched Avengers Infinity War and I thought I should watch the other movies that I missed. It turns out I did watch Age of Ultron and Civil War but I totally forgot. These movies just go right through me. But it was cool watching it again.
