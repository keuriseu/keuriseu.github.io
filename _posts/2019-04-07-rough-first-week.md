This week was rough. It's just the first week but there are lots of assignments. I wanted to know what it was like to have 5 credits. Be careful what you wish for. There are really cool things that happened this week. Dinner with the ACL group. Night out with Moroccstars. 

Here's a story. We were at this birthday party for the 1 year old baby of a Chilean family. The grandmother greeted us and went in to have a closer look at the baby. She went in too close to the space between Sean and my faces. Silly me thought she wanted to kiss as a greeting. Isn't that what Brazilians do? Does everyone else do that? Well I had not much time to decide so I went for it and rubbed my cheek against her. Awkward. I've never done that with a stranger. So weird.

So now I'm in the middle of a lot of things. And at home, Sean just keeps crying. Oh my god would that make you crazy, man.

And a bad week in basketball too. I've been to comfortable shooting threes. That's not what you want. It will diminish my whole game. I'll be out for redemption. Let's go.
