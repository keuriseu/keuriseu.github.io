The farewell tour has started. I had lunch with Hyeonjin which reminded me that I had great teammates once upon a time.

Sean smiles and laughs a lot know. What a splendidly beautiful sight to see. He also makes funny mumbling sounds like he is doing right now while listening to nursery rhymes.

As an NBA fan without a home team, I suddenly find myself rooting for Chicago in the draft. They're in a rebuild right now but they should still be fun to watch. Go bulls!
