Damn what is it with me and losing passports. Earlier I almost made a bad decision to push through to the airport without Soyeon's passport. Now I lost my passport in the SEA to PDX flight. I hope I get a call soon man. I'm now in a room without freakin light. What the hell is this. I miss my Soyeon and Sean. But Portland looks nice. Strange people all over but they seem nice. First day tomorrow. I hope my bad luck has ran out at this point.

Training done. Am I being convinced too easily again or is my gut feel legit? I think I will thrive in a place where there is a system in place and all you need is the discipline to stick with the process. I think there are great opportunities for career growth here. Well now I just have to secure and offer first and kick ass in the internship.

I feel like shit.

So Portland's cool. It has a calm and relaxed vibe. The city is not bustling but not empty either. I've been to the best tour I've been part of. The Shanghai tunnels. It seems legit. Imagine all the shit people did before.

I have mad respect to those in long distance relationships. It's hard man. Being away from your family. My family is my priority. I need to be in a job where I spend time with them.
