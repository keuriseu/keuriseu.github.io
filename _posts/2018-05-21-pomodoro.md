I unexpectedly binged a Coursera - Learning How to Learn. True to the teachings of this course, the best way to learn is to recall and practice the things you have learned to create chunks in your brain and engrave it in the long term memory.

## Pomodoros
* blogging, financial update, shuffling, investment updates

> Law of Serendipity - Lady Luck favors those who try.

## The process
I realized that this particular tip has been effective for me.

In studying for GMAT, what helped me was the daily set of questions from GMAT Club, instead of focusing on a target score.

## Time to be superhuman
Eat frogs first
plan
reward yourself
delay rewards
