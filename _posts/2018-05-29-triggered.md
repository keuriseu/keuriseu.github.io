Tuesday, coming back from basketball, picked up by Soyeon and Sean, I was getting Sean ready for bath when I bent down to raspberry his tummy and it suddenly happened. Bright lights. After Sean drank his milk and burped, I felt the migraine letting its presence be known. I put a topical relief patch on my forehead and I had a relatively good sleep. For the next time this happens, always be ready with pas by your side. Migraine is just the worst.

## GOAT

LeBron, man. 8 consecutive trips to the finals. Leading a team reassembled mid-season, playing 24 games together, to the finals. What more can ask for from this guy? Breaking records. Dominating at 33. We are all witnessing greatness. Long live the King!

## Why rings aren't be-all and end-all

The remaining argument against LeBron is his finals record. 3-5 and soon to be 3-6. This doesn't mean that he chokes on the biggest stage or that he doesn't have that killer instinct that MJ, with his perfect 6 and 0, had. But look at the odds. LeBron has been favored just twice, competing against great all-time teams that he actually stole the limelight from. He (his teams) managed to beat the odds and bring home 3 championships, including the biggest upset in history. Compare this with Kobe whose teams were favored 7 out of 7 times but brought home 5 rings, having Shaq, the most dominant big man in the game, on his side for 3 of those years. Just give LeBron his due. He is a true underdog who had odds against him from the beginning but consistently proves doubters wrong.

Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.
