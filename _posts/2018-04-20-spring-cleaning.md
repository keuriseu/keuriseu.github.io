So it has been a busy week. A lot of driving. A lot of cleaning. To start it off, I met Camsy, showed her Sean, showed her and her fam around Bucheon and Bukchon. It was splendid seeing her again after the last time she was in Seoul which was my wedding. It is amazing that she has started her own company and doing life insurance related work. That is really impressive and I really wish her all the best in her career switch. Let's go ERG North America!

I've been cleaning the whole week! I've collected useless things after many years. It was liberating to throw away stuff I don't use. I found my missing action camera at least. I'm just getting started and for sure moving's gonna be a pain.

I bathed Sean for the first time. He cried a lot after that. Looked like he wanted to drink more milk even after 3 bottles. Now I'm really learning how to father.

## Missing Pepper

The house is just not the same without Pepper. It's cleaner, at least. I just hope she finds a temporary home with Natalia and that's the most important. She seems to be having a more active life with Natalia, walking more than an hour a day.

## Sean is home

Now we have Sean by ourselves, no one to help us. First day has passed and so far so good. He's been a good boy. House is cleaner too. We'll see what it's really gonna be like in the next week.
