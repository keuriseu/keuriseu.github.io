title: Basketball Never Stops

## Facers

Nothing like basketball at the end of a long day. Basketball was usually the highlight of my day, especially during the days when work sucked. It was quite a story. I started out as the awkward foreigner, picked last in the draft. Started out as a bench player, eager to score my first points. It came soon enough. They started to respect my mid range shot. Give me a little daylight on the perimeter, money. Then I became the go to scorer, the team "ace". Your most improved player who balled out in league games. The recognition felt good. But we weren't winning, nevertheless I was glad with the spotlight. Until I really wanted to win. I knew I can't win by myself, far from it. I was pushed to the be a guard, hesistantly though it worked. In the final season, we were winning. Team infused with real veteran contributors but it was too late. I won't be here to witness a real winning season. Facers basketball was my sanctuary. I didn't talk much with the guys but we played. We balled. I evolved as a player. I watched great hyeongnims and stood my ground.

## Winners

Where I experienced the famed military Korean style. It was tough from the beginning. I was raw and they were not looking to play the bench guys. My talent just wasn't enough but my improvement was undeniable. I held on for as long as I could which was long enough. It would have been better if I entered more as a finished product. But this is where I learned the fundamentals. This team required commitment and I ran out in the end. I had other priorities in mind. But I know I owe my development to the Winners (the name hasn't up to now and never will grow on me).

## PIKO

Pinoy basketball. Real warriors. Fun group but lacked dedication. I was pushed to play center as was the case back in Pinas. We played in an outdoor court in SNU. Not ideal but we managed. The style was different. Real scrappy, wise old man game. The one-day leagues, showed real Filipinoness. Programs sucked, make do packed lunches, muses, dance performances, late start, really bad gyms. But the brotherhood was great. Found some real genuine guys in there.
