My life in shambles, days before final exams. So no one wants to do Risk Lab with me. I think we got the short end of the stick, thinking that Qantas is the best company to choose. Seems not. The loyalty project was a bore. And there's this project related with farms that I want to get involved in. Oh by the way, Russell just mentioned this thing about choosing the city where you get the most saved. Cash is king. And Samsung is the one who gives the most (I think). It would be irresponsible of me not to consider that, given my history with South Korea. Now what to do? Earn the most money in Samsung, basically living free of rent. With three meals a day. Live very comfortably. Earn enough cash, without having to work late, in a country I'm used to living, working with people I like to work with. MBA people. But are the exit opportunities good? When will I be ready to take on a business.

June: Do you have any dietary restrictions?
Me: No. We eat everything lol.
June: Okay we're having rabbit head.
Well, I don't think people include rabbit head in standard dietary considerations.

2 down, 2 to go. Pacific Northwest here we go!
