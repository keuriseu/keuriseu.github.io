I'm down with the sickness, caught a cold. I certainly am missing out on the parties, pot lucks, tailgates and pre-games. I need to step it up.

I wonder how next week will play out. 

Sean is getting bigger and bigger. He's now eating baby food.

Soyeon will be more active.

And I will keep on keeping on.

## The Zipcar experience

Retention, not only acquisition, is important for a starting business. I was surprised by zipcar about my over mileage fee. I did not read that anywhere and suddenly they charge me making my total bill double. Really uncool. Good thing I expressed that sentiment in the feedback and they refunded me the fee. Thanks Zipcar. I might use you again in the future. But just be transparent.
