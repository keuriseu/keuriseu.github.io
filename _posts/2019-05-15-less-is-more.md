In my second year, I would soon know which areas I want to focus on. Operations? General management is a broad term. Public speaking? Building soft skills? It is clear that there is too much shit going on and I need to narrow down my focus. I wanted to experience a lot and now I'm struggling to keep everything together.

Nashville - hot chicken, bachelorette parties, country music, scooters. It was a horrible experience witnessing a friend get hit by a car. I felt helpless and did not know what to do. It's a miracle Sun got out of the situation with just minor bruises. I went to the country music hall of fame alone, and I had a great time. I was living my best life back in Nashville. I bonded somewhat with a few great people. And now I'm back - for the final push.

Minutes before I watch the final Game of Thrones episode. I mean, what a show this was. It was a fresh series, with lots of cool characters, and awesome scenes. What would the next big series? I can't wait.
