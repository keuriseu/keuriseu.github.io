Four weeks in, I made my first report, an awkward time. Now in the middle of creating an action plan. We'll finish this strong.

I'm too lazy to go out and see Portland now. I'm just reading books at home.

I miss my babies back in Korea. My passport was found! I wish Delta had a separate process for passports. They'll have the owners lose hope due to the slowness of their system, man.

Great to know about Rocketman. Great movie.
