I know this feeling all too well. I could not concentrate during Fin II. Sidebar, the theme of my MBA life: have all these crazy ideas during the first year and see what sticks for the second year. Anyway, the dream is to own a farm. Live in a glorious ranch and produce for yourself and the world. But before that I want to get exposed to farms. See what's near. Know farm operations. An opportunity while here in Kellogg is to do an independent study, guided by a Professor, get real world experience and solve a farm's problem. I neeed to network and go out there to make this dream come true. Move to Oregon, consult for farms over there, citing my experience here in Illinois. Know shit about agriculture. Be an operations master. And someday own a farm.

But why though? It's all tied with giving back to the motherland. Make life better for farmers. Feed the world. All that shiz. Let's make this happen.

When talking about the Supply Chain, first look at the SC surplus. What is the value to the customers - responsiveness or efficient (low cost)? What are the costs to the supply chain? And then find out where the uncertainty is. Is it in the demand or in the supply? Who absorbs the uncertainty? Is it the customers through pricing? Or the manufacturer or distributor.

Interesting how to consider outsourcing. The value of outsourcers comes from aggregating the volatile and uncertain demand from different manufacturers. However this lowers the barrier to entry. Which is why now it is easy to make a phone. Every aspect can be outsourced and so it benefits the companies to differentiate and invest in marketing and technology.
