It's time to take a break and be thankful. I'm thankful for everything that happened for past year. It's been a wild ride. I'm thankful for my loving wife who supports my plans for our family. I'm thankful for my beautiful son who gives joy to our family. I'm thankful for this great opportunity in Kellogg to expand our horizons, meet great people, enjoy wonderful experiences. Always be thankful, always be grateful.

A well-deserved break. We're going to the Big Easy! Just take a break from everything and enjoy the trip. Personally I'm very excited to see a Pelican game.

Ah, cover letters. Ahhh, recruitment, in general. This is what we came here for. I hope I get the jobs that would be perfect for me.

Just watched Coco. Learned about Disney this week. Coco was a great movie. It's all about the story. Who makes these stories, man?
