I had four interviews. I bombed the Cisco case interview so bad. I got invited to MetLife for the second round. But the real story is the curse mark that appeared on my face just in time for my interviews. To add to what was already a stressful week.

In other news I've been bingeing on Naruto and Paper.io game. I hope to hear good news next week. Please someone give me a job.

Sean cries whenever we shout. Such an angel making his parents not raise voices.
