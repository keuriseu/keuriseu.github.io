I just became a dad (yay!) but things are picking up very slowly. This must be the calm before the storm. In three weeks, we will take home Sean and deal with parenting ourselves. In a month, I will process our housing and visas. In two months, we're gonna sell the house and pack. The closer August gets, I'll be more anxious. Better for me to just enjoy the present and go with the flow.

## On Cuteness

Is it possible for parents to think that their baby is ugly? I prepared myself to see an ugly baby since pictures of newborn babies I have seen do not look cute at all. But from the moment I saw my son come out of my wife, I was all smiles and just saw beauty. Bias? Maybe, maybe not, I'm just happy we have a cute healthy baby to look at.

I used this as my opening remarks in Toastmasters this week. I bombed so hard. Moral of the story is to practice short anecdotes too, especially ones that I'm angling with humor. I felt nervous too, sharing something personal.

## Flavor of the week

Love was a 98% match according to Netflix. I liked Britta from Community but somehow I passed on watching this show. But I discovered an Aussie illusionist [Claudia O'Doherty](https://youtu.be/bNcj9iR956M) from a hilarious Conan interview. Saw some more of her videos and decided to watch the show. Turns out, Netflix was right on the money on this one. The show is funny, relatable, and entertaining. Finished Season 1 in one week. Also, Briga Heelan is gorgeous.

The series has ended apparently. I wonder why this wasn't more of a hit, otherwise it wouldn't have been cancelled. This now the second cancelled Netflix series I was fond of that have been cancelled (the other being Sense8).
