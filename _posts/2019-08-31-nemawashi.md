Hello Philippines. The experience right from the airport has been very pinoy. Disorganized, dirty, desperate. Pros and cons in living here. Pros - low cost of living, house help. Cons - low quality of living, traffic. hot weather.

Sean has been sick. Poor baby. He's struggling with pain. I hope there's nothing wrong with him. Get well soon baby.

The house is so dirty. It has been abused and neglected. What to do here?

Still no word from Fortive and it's the time to reassess the situation and really talk about life.
