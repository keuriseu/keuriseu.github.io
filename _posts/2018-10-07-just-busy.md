Well it's another down week. Went to an Evanston bar for the first time - Evanston Rocks. Had a great time. Music is always great.

Sadly we are not moving on with the Deloitte case competition. It's fine. We are all bogged down by official work anyway.

Met the KICC team this week. I'm excited to do this. I hope to learn a lot.

Raised my hand for the first time in Strategy. And I realize that I know a lot about technology and it's something I took for granted. I wrote down Seattle as my consulting target location because I like the city and I had experience in tech. I wonder how alien it feels for other classmates who don't have much technical background.

Sean is getting cuter and more handsome by the day. He's also becoming a handful. Just crying and crawling. And he crawls fast.

Will I be able to submit the Kellogg Board Fellows application? Time will tell.

Sean's sixth month checkup last week. He's down to 94th percentile. Did he peak too soon? Catch up, son.
