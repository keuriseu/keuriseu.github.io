Enter the Kellogg Time Warp. It is midterm season already with consulting recruiting kicking off. There's a lot going on.

I had a good networking session with Deloitte. It's becoming realer by the day.

This is a buzzer beater post. With too much happening I haven't had time to write down my thoughts.

I am applying to be a KWEST leader. I became directors for SEA Club and PSC Club. I'm waiting on Kellogg Board Fellows but I'm not hopeful.

Life is good.
