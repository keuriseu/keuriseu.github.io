## Feel the love

It's not what I expected. I came in thinking I would quietly leave like I quietly stayed. *I didn't do so bad.* I did make an impact and I did not realize it until this week. I met all the people that I had to meet. The messages they left to me were special, heartwarming, touching. The last meals and coffees, much appreciated.

Jatin has affected me more than I even knew he did. We've been through a lot. I'm glad I have found a friend like him.

It was about ending things right with Mr. Kim, who after all was my mentor and boss for 5 years. I could have just left without a word and I wouldn't even know that I should regret it. I'm happy where I am now and I will cherish his guidance through the years. He was a great boss.

To Sangmin, Sue, Yikyung, Wonkyun, Geonuk, Yunyoung, Eunjoo, Ted, Hajae, Dev, Hoseock, Muthu, Krishna, Niladri, Guneet, Ankit, Kevin, Eunsol, Bingxu, Leo, Tim, Leian, Vince, Youngwook, Yongwoo, Hyunjoo, Hakyung, Daekyu, Sanggon, Yeongsuk, Okseon, Joaquin, Indu, Heejin, MJ, Gunny, Jinhyun, Sanghyun, Wooyoung, Jongjin, Junsoo, Wonjin, Dani, Jaehoon, Seungbeom, Yoohyun and everyone else I have surely missed, thank you, thank you, thank you.

6 years is quite a long time, the longest stretch that I stayed in one place. I am happy to leave the place knowing I have built connections. Along with the lesson that I should take advantage of these relationships while I can.

With that begins my next chapter. On to the next one.
