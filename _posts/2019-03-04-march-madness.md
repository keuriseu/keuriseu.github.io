So here's a story by the great Robert Bray on the exponential distribution - the second greatest distribution because of the memoryless property. Actually this story is about the geometric distribution because it is discrete. So he and Nabil, a fellow professor, had the exact same story about exponential distribution. Not much of a story, it's about how Christopher Walken played Russian Roulette in some movie. End of story. Epic guy.

Surprised to see queueing theory in business school, I'm at home with this. But the looks on my classmates' faces were discouraging. I myself was thinking if this really belonged in business school. Of course it is. But yeah. It is what it is.

Kellogg won! I hit two threes and a layup. It was a good game. I kept us in the game during a crucial point. It felt good. I need to be more effective next time with defense and rebounding.

Finals season is here again. I'm looking to get A's this quarter. Instead of getting straight B's. They called me Buzz.
