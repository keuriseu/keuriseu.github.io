So I have almost 1600 bid points left. It means I pick differently from the rest of Kellogg. I'm going for classes that I don't necessarily want to take but I feel would be valuable in the internship and after Kellogg.

In my Entrepreneurship Through Acquisition class, we had to choose between two companies, which of them should the partners buy. I was surprised when I was the only who chose one of the options. It was surprising for a class of around 60. What are the chances? So I had to explain myself and I think my reasoning was good. Jay Davis also said that the investors really liked United, whereas they didn't really love VDIC. I was more in line with the investors but the total opposite of Kellogg students in my class.

So I ran into Ahsan who got into Fortive and Amazon but is ultimately choosing Amazon. I got a couple of great information from him. Most of the interns last year did not get a return offer and the reasons for that is diverse but mostly the interns' fault. One did not prepare for the final presentation, thinking it was just an update. The other did not even dress for the situation. It is important to dress and act like a general manager at all times. This is something I will keep in mind. I bought the book The General Managers to have a view of what a general manager is. Fortive applies for green card at day one. This is really good. And Fluke is the majority of Fortive and people who move from Fluke to other OpCos get a higher position or salary. But let's see how Tektronix goes.
