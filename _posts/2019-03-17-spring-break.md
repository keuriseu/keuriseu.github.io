It doesn't feel like a Sunday. I woke up and rushed to the hub to take the MECN exam, the second of three. Tomorrow's the last one, OPNS, and I have to finish my ETA slides after that. I felt good after FIN and MECN. Imagine that, feeling good about probably two courses I had no background in and was intimidated by.

So everyone's leaving Evanston for Spring break, going somewhere nice. I'll use it to get my life into order. Do things I missed doing. Read the backlog of books I aggressively ordered. I have a feeling the St. Louis trip will be fun.

Sean is really cute now. I miss him whenever I'm not with him. When I'm with him I'm so gigil.

Let's recharge for two weeks!
