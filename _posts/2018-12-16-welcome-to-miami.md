We're here in Miami! Miami is a cool place where the rich and famous own houses in. Majority of the population are Latin Americans and many people speak Spanish as a first language. The beach is beautiful. I could stay there whole day and read a book. Surprisingly it has the third longest skyline in the US after NY and Chicago. The weather is great. I could live here.

Well the results are out. Zero in consulting. That was something. So probably it is really not for me. As if I needed any more confirmation. Then Tech and General Management it is. It's good that one of the options was eliminated, making my life easier.

Alright then. So long, from the Sunshine state.

Great read.
