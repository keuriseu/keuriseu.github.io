It's the last day of my two week paternity leave. I literally had my hands full with Sean all week. The first round of the playoffs, Santa Clarita Diet, a little Case in Point, pretty much sums up the week. 장희엄마 bought us two month's worth of food. She's really great supporting us. Sean has a really strong grip on my finger. And he is crying right now. Sometimes I don't know what to do to make him stop. Babies, man. He's really cute though. That helps.

## Flavor of the week

The playoffs are on! Great timing on my paternity leave. Utah is an exciting team and the matchup with the star-studded OKC. They are playing team basketball with a rag tag group of international players and a promising rookie. Spida Mitchell is the ROY for me. He just takes over the offense and could get to the rim at will. LeBron and Lance are fun to watch too.

Santa Clarita Diet. A show that I didn't know what to expect. It turns out it's a hilarious series about zomies. A zombie comedy, who would have thought?
