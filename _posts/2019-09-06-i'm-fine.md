I'm fine. It was not a good fit. Recruiting is trying it on for size both ways. There are lots of other companies and opportunities out there. I had a great time in Tektronix. I learned a lot. I was challenged, I conquered, and I have great stories coming out of it. 

Now is the time to keep focus. That's why it's a two-year program - to explore during the first year. I tried out General Management, I liked it. I like structure and following a system and path. I tried out operations, I liked it. I like having an impact on the business, which was what I was looking for coming in to business school.

Unfortunately, my journey doesn't end here and I'm not going to chill in the second year as much as I would have liked. I will keep grinding and fighting. I will challenge myself and I will come out satisfied in the end. I'm fine and I'm ready to go.
