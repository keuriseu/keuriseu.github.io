> What's in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.

Ah, the intricacies of naming a child in Korea. Son, you were originally named 시현. What I wanted was simple. You would be known as 이시현 in Korea, Sean Lee Olavario elsewhere (and on the romanized name on the Korean passport). Apparently, the name needs to match the Korean characters. That means Sean won't be allowed becuase the ㅎ character is missing.

The idea was to have a name that sounds both Korean and English. There are not a lot of such options for boy names. The other option was Jason (재손 or 재승) but your mom didn't like that.
