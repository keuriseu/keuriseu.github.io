Tuesday, coming back from basketball, picked up by Soyeon and Sean, I was getting Sean ready for bath when I bent down to raspberry his tummy and it suddenly happened. Bright lights. After Sean drank his milk and burped, I felt the migraine letting its presence be known. I put a topical relief patch on my forehead and I had a relatively good sleep. For the next time this happens, always be ready with pas by your side. Migraine is just the worst.

## GOAT

LeBron, man. 8 consecutive trips to the finals. Leading a team reassembled mid-season, playing 24 games together, to the finals. What more can ask for from this guy? Breaking records. Dominating at 33. We are all witnessing greatness. Long live the King!

## Quote of the week

Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.
