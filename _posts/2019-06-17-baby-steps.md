Sean finally walked. 10 steps for it to count. It's like a real milestone that once you clear it, you're an official walker. The environment was the problem. It was too small for him to naturally think about walking, not to crawl instead. Good job my boy.

What an eventful moving day. I missed a flight for the first time. I packed Soyeon's passport. I did it. But at that time I would have thought I would never pack something like a passport. My mind really flies sometimes. I need to think straight.

Raptors win. The GS dynasty looks like it's ending. LeBron got AD. Fun stuff. Moving to the PNW real soon.
