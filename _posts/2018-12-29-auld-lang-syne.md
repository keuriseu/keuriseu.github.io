2018 was a crazy year. A lot of life changes happened: having a son, moving to the US, changing careers, everything else. Lots of learnings too, I hope. What would the next year bring? I don't really want to think about it right now. I'm just happy and I think we moved to the right direction.

I'm thankful for everything that happened this year, and thankful for the people I shared it with.

Right now, I have two days to make the most of 2018, to relax and keep preparing. We'll take a cup of kindness yet, for auld lang syne.
