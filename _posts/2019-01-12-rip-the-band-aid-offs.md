I was going back and forth about cancelling my Cisco interview but I figured it will be a good practice round for me before the companies I really like interview me. Yes, here we are. Interview season has arrived. What if I suck? What if no company offers an internship to me? - is what everyone is thinking right now. I think. But it will all be over soon. This is really stressful. You just want to get great offers.

You know how Dads make their wallpapers pictures of their kids? Now I understand. I just want to look at Sean all day. Such cuteness, never fails to make you smile. I love my family. Now time to get a job to support them.
