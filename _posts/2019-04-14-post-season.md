Playoffs started. Game of Thrones returns. The quarter is getting traction. I'll be a president of the Public Speaking Club - I still haven't fully embraced that role. I'll be an AMA Basketball Club captain - I do like that.

ACL has started and I like my team. I like my groups this quarter. I feel comfortable.

Went to Fremont for brunch. Got more than brunch. Mimosas got me. That's all folks.
