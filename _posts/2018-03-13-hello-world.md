Blogging is one of the things I have always wanted to do. This is not the first attempt. There are a few of my blogs out there in cyberspace that had one or two posts in it and that's it. What makes this attempt different? Nothing, except that I have a feeling that this one will stick. A lot of life changes are lined up for me this year - first child, MBA, new city, new life. And a lot has happened during the past years that I feel regretful that I haven't done a good job documenting them. All that is done but there's a lot more to come. So here's to the upcoming events in my life. Sit back and enjoy.
