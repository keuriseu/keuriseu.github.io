It's Kaizen week and I totally forgot to update. I'm now questioning why I have this blog in the first place. 

I was anxious the whole week because of the fucking kaizen and it turned out to be okay. It's the final stretch. We're getting there.

I'll be reunited with my baby, Pepper, real soon. <3
