Sean, the happy baby, turned one. We survived this week. Had a number of guests come to our house. Hosting is an art and we need practice. I'd like to do more of these in the future. Make our house warm and welcoming to people.

Spring break is over. I was not able to get through readings but we accomplished things. Had great vacations. Soyeon gets her license. Leveled up on life, a bit.

I have yet to see a good close game live. The Rockets were a let down.
