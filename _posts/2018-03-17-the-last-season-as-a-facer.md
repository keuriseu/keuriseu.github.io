We won! Elusive words that I have been longing to say for such a long time now. Basketball in Digital City has been my saving grace from the stresses at work. But unfortunately our team has been winless for the last two years. This year is my last and I will leave the team mid-season. It would have been depressing if I left without winning. This year is something to look forward to. The team added new key players who will surely improve our chances this season. 

The league now tracks stats which is pretty neat. Seeing your stats after the game gives that professional league feeling. I wish they have started this earlier.
