It was my first time in Africa but Morocco is part European, Berber, Arab, West African. It was a country new to me. New people, new terrain, new food. The country is not the most tourist friendly country. The great thing is I was able to this trip with a large group because I might not be able to pull off this trip with me planning.

Something noteworthy, I'm glad Laura was with me in this trip. We went through annoying visa issues together. I got to know here the most in the trip.

## Less than ideal

So it did not go as well as I planned. Clearly, I struggled socializing with people. And that's okay. There are lots of things I need to work on. Butting in and sharing my opinion more actively. Butting in and asking someone what they are talking about or asking to explain the context. Initializing conversations. I do think that I will get better at this as time goes by.

## Party culture

Kellogg parties hard. I knew that going in. And it's okay if I choose to skip parties. I just have to handle missing out on them better. I have better things to use my time for than to party.

## Unfinished business

The trip didn't go as I had expected and so I want another chance at KWEST. I am intrigued by becoming a KWEST leader but I want a trip with adventurous activities and few parties. I will find a way to include internationals with Americans. I still don't know how at this point.

## Dino

On my way to find fridge magnets, I was approached by Dino. It was quite a nice surprise and he did give me a great tour. I did pay more than I should have. And in retrospect it is never a good idea to talk to strangers, much less go into their house. Nevertheless, you have to admire the guy. He has a way with people. He might have told me lies but it worked. And he got his money. It is a lesson for me to strive to obtain what he has. Charisma.

## Summary

After letting everything sink in, Morocco was amazing! I ended up choosing a great KWEST destination aside from the visa free entry. It was a great adventure.
