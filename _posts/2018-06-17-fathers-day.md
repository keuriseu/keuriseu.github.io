It's been busy. Packing. Preparing. Fathering. Things to do here and there. My parents and Ming came to Korea to see Sean for the first time. They were very happy to see their grandson from their best child.

It was a blast. We stayed in a condo in Boryeong, met Soyeon's mom and dad, drove around a lot, and ate great food. The highlight for me was the karaoke session in Jang Hee Eomma's noraebang. My mom, for the first time in her life according to her, sang in the karaoke. It was fun. Now I actually enjoy their old songs with me not thinking it was baduy. We really rocked out. It would have been really nice if my sister were there.

I didn't realize that it was my first Fathers day as a dad.
