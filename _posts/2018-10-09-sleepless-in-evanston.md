It's 4AM and I'm wide awake. Today, err... yesterday, Sangita spoke about Samsung GSG in the panel Strategy vs Consulting. It is intriguing, to say the least, the prospect of going back to Korea for at least four years. Kid(s) can grow for a few years there. Relatives are there. Benefits are good. No need to worry about housing. There is a sense of unfinished business that does not sit well with me. But the question is, will I be happy?

Another reason I can't sleep is that I've failed to crack leadership positions in the admissions committee and Charity Auction Ball. I also missed my chance in applying for AMA, which is a really cool group. I hesitated to apply because of all the other applications I already submitted. And now Public Speaking has not yet reached out while Aakriti already got her acceptance. Wild week. This must be FOMO. 

Thoughts keeping me up? Well I guess readings won't read themselves.

## Brand Positioning

This is awesome. The context of this clip is sustaing brand position. Gum positioning evolved from a hygienic practical purpose to an abstract emotional side that is community and sharing. This is a well-made ad.

Run like a girl, fight like a girl, throw like a girl. Man, this is powerful. Context - Brand Purpose. Why does this brand exist (beyond the goal of financial gain)? Sidebar, an interesting conversation with Eliza today. She worked for non profits like the One Acre Fund and she won't be going back to non profits. She doesn't believe non profits will save the world. Hmmm. Interesting perspective from someone who has actual experience in the industry.

This is wholesome. Who knew there are lots of great commercials like these? This is very powerful.
