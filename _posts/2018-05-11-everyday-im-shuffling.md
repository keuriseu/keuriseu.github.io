I challenge myself to shuffle and to do push ups everyday. Sometimes you need that extra push and that will be provided by an app. Recording helps. Reminding helps. Building momentum helps. And that is what the will, I'm hoping, provide.

But why shuffle? I can't dance and I am 31. At this point I have accepted that I am awkward and my body was never made to move to entertain. And that's fine. But I also think that if you train your body enough you will see results. So this week I have started to shuffle. Let's see what happens after some (long) time.

## Kellogg Yield Party

It was great meeting all my classmates from Korea and the alumni. Some of them were people in high positions and I could only hope to be in their shoes someday. Joonho Lee, an LEK partner, even offered to help me get an interview in the US office. I'm just excited to get to Evanston at this point.

## Flavor of the week

This week I watched David Letterman's My Next Guest Needs No Introduction with guests Jay Z and Tina Fey. These are two celebrities who got to where they are because of exceptional talent although it is easy to look past that and think that they are just somehow famous. I particularly was interested in improv from the way Tina Fey described it. I remember Kelsie telling us during DAK that there was a club in Kellogg. And Second City, something famous, is in Chicago. I am definitely intrigued. It's just a matter of will I actually give this a try or if time will allow it during MBA.
