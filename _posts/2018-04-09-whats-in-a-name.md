> What's in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet. -William Shakespeare

Ah, the intricacies of naming a child in Korea. The idea was to have a name that sounds both Korean and English. There are not a lot of such options for boy names. The other option was Jason (재손 or 재승) but your mom didn't like that.

Son, you were originally named 시현 and that's what we called you during your first week. What I wanted was simple. You would be known as 이시현 in Korea, Sean Lee Olavario elsewhere (and on the romanized name on the Korean passport). Apparently, the name needs to match the Korean characters. That means Sean won't be allowed because the ㅎ character is missing. And so you are named 시언(諡彦) which your mom likes.

선비 언 彦

And it doesn't end there. Soyeon will change your chinese name. 복 시.

In English, Sean is the Irish variant of John, meaning God is gracious, or gift from God.

## Week of losses

We lost this time. I missed all my shots in the 1st half. I didn't find the shooting touch until the 4th quarter. On top of that, I fouled out. Got myself in trouble in the 1st quarter with three fouls. We just weren't feeling it that night and dug ourselves a hole from the start. Tough loss. 

I'm not keeping the box score this time. They got stats wrong anyway.

PIKO got creamed by FCIS. I played center throughout and it was tough getting rebounds. I need to be fundamentally sound in that area. Find contact, box out, and grab the ball with two hands. I'll be a better center next time.

And just like that, Pepper is gone. I feel sad whenever I see her pictures and when I walked where we used to walk. But I know she'll be having more fun with Natalia who has more time to spare. You'll always be our girl, Pepper. 

## Flavor of the week

Finished Love this week. I kept waiting for Mickey to tell Gus about Dustin. It never happened, which sucks. That skeleton in the closet will find its way out in the future somehow. I mean, it's great that two people with huge issues found love with each other but keeping the cheating thing from your partner just isn't cool. It was a fun series with lots of low key hilarious moments. Like the one when Gus was asking Arya a favor. Great stuff. 

> I will do this one thing for you. Ever. This will be the one time that I do something for you. Do you want this to be the one time that I do something for you? Your one favor. There's a lot of other things I could do for you. Right. In the world. And you're choosing this. Are you sure about that? - It's scary when you say - Yeah, I hope it's scary. I hope you're very scared because there's a lot of other things I could do for you and this is what you're choosing. Okay.
