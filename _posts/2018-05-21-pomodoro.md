I unexpectedly binged a Coursera - Learning How to Learn. True to the teachings of this course, the best way to learn is to recall and practice the things you have learned to create chunks in your brain and engrave it in the long term memory.

## Pomodoros
* blogging, financial update, shuffling, investment updates

## Zombie mode

* Do push ups everyday at 6:30 AM

> Law of Serendipity - Lady Luck favors those who try.

## Time to be superhuman

plan
reward yourself
delay rewards
