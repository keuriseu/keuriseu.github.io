So I took a turn from consulting. I should not force myself to a job that does not match my current priorities. Where will I end up?

Thanksgiving break coming soon. We all need a break. And give thanks. So thanks.

I'm feeling tired right now. I'm always sick. Last week it was my tongue that formed a canker sore. Painful AF. Glad that's over.
