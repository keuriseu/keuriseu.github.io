> The weird thing is now I'm exactly where I want to be. I've got my dream job at Cornell, and I'm still just thinking about my old pals. Only now they're the ones I made here. I wish there was a way to know you're in "the good old days", before you've actually left them.

Some feelings you just don't expect. Especially for someone who was itching to leave and go to a better place, I find myself realizing that my current situation isn't all that bad that I picture it to be. Regret is also hanging around, because these are great people that have surrounded me throughout the years. Why did I not grab the chances to reach out, to socialize, to live. But all of that is in the past now. I believe my personality has changed. Everyday is part of the learning process.

On this penultimate week, I had a dialogue the VP. Something that I had never done before. It is always a good opportunity to speak with someone of that stature. Here's what I said to him, I want to be in a role that makes major decisions in corporate strategy. He did give me some words of wisdom. It was a hweshik that I unexpectedly enjoy.

I also talked to my donggi, Eunsol. It took me this long to actually talk to her and she seemed like a great person. I suddenly contacted Catarina. I have always felt ashamed for keeping distance from my SVP team. Why did I do that? I should have kept in touch. It's really a waste. But at the same there are people I kept in touch with like Bingxu, who has been there with me since we entered.

## The best words someone said to me

Acting as the president of SOTM made it clear what my tendencies are as a leader. I had the vision of what the club could be. We had taken great steps to becoming a better club. I did play a role in that, along with reliable officers. Hearing Dev speak about me provided the confirmation that I would ever need, if ever I needed that. I am someone who works consistently, sometimes at the background, not wanting credit for the work done, but a lot of times to a fault. I need to find the balance between being the vocal leader as compared to the leader who leads through actions.

Toastmasters has been good to me. The love I received throughout this whole farewell tour... I could not ask for more.

## The hardest goodbye

At that moment, I realized that there was nothing else I can do. I broke down. I cried. I felt sorry for Pepper. She became my responsibility once I decided to adopt her. It is sad that it had to turn out like this. Sad that Natalia had allergies. Sad that we couldn't bring her with us. Pepper, you really are the best. You have been the source of countless smiles, laughs, positive feelings. At least in the short time we had together, I hope you enjoyed having us as humans as we enjoyed you, good doggie. Don't lose hope, at the very least we'd get to visit you within two years.
