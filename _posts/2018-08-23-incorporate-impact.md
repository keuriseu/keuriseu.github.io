## Shark Tank

ACE ended and I took lots of goodies with me. I'm happy with the way I started my Kellogg life. Although it was an easier environment. It ended with silliness, doing Shark Tank as a shark. So silly. Most of the groupmates thought it was too silly but I, along with Takuya, felt that it was needed. I thought it was something that is risky but the payoff will be huge. We read the situation perfectly. The best product won't necessarily win, instead the most entertaining. But the right teammates are essential for a high performing. I admire Brunna's leadership and sophistication, Laura's efficiency, Takuya's innovation, Rosa's design sense, Jieul's initiative, everyone's teamwork. Superb job.

Being in ACE together hopefully will give us a sense of camaraderie that we went through that experience altogether, being internationals coming and living in the US for the first time.

## Plastuck

I had a tough time with group brainstorming. My teammates carried us and we struggled to come up with an idea until there was not enough time remaining. In the end we came up with collecting and recycling one time use plastic bags. We had a great reaction when I presented about the problem. I thought it helped but the judges thought we lacked depth (at least I thought so). It was a good experience.

More than that, I felt reassured that social impact needs to be a part of what I do. I will be happy if I feel my work affects people largely and positively. I'll be sure to incorporate impact in my Kellogg and future undertakings.

## Feel at home

I finally met Mars and the Pinoys in Kellogg. You'll always feel at home with fellow countrymen. Although it is comfortable, it is not for comfort that I came here. We will grow together, I'll make sure of that.

## And so it begins

Tomorrow we set for Morocco. Just bring it.
