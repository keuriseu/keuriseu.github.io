I am excited. I had a call with Jon, the VP of Operations in Tektronix. We discussed the possible projects over the summer. I'm getting what I want! Lean conversion - the perfect project for what I have been learning this quarter. I finished reading It's Not Luck and I think relying on the Thinking Processes and Theory of Constraints would be beneficial for me over the summer. I have a lot of reading to do.

The product of a rough morning. I think I have a million dollar idea - an all-weather jacket. There's a bunch of jackets in my closet but since the weather became single digits I have only worn one. All the others are good for just a few days in a year. What a waste. What if you had a jacket that can be adjusted to the weather. Warmer when you need it. Cooler when the weather goes up a bit. How do I control the warmth level? Put more feathers in? Charge it and let it dissipate heat? Add more layers? A modular jacket? This goes against the lesson from marketing to not be the all purpose solution because you will not please all customers. But this product can target people who are minimalists, who don't want a lot of display jackets in their closet. 

Gwynne Shotwel, an uninspiring President/COO. I was excited for this brave leader event but was disappointed with the result. She's been in her position for 17 years but nothing came out that was inspiring. Sure, she was entertaining but she had canned answers. In the end I got nothing out of it. SpaceX as a company is predicated on the underlying belief that mankind should explore another habitat when the Earth becomes uninhabitable. But aren't there enough problems in the world to be spending on rockets. Will rocket ships ever be profitable for commercial flight? Should it? It seems wasteful to me. What will you do when you get to Mars? Live in a space suit? I don't agree with the existence of the company. I hope there will be better speakers in the future. It's a shame the biggest name company speaker turned out to be a total drag.
