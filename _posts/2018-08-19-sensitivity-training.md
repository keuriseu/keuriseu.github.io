A lot of things happened this week. We played flag football where my competitive nature came out, prompting Rosa to tell me I am not a gentleman. It was all good. Some people are competitive, some people play for the fun of it. As with most things else, just find the balance.

The highlight was 'The Weekly'. I was excited and looking forward to the opportunity to speak in public. This time about the Philippines, which many people won't know about. I think I was able to speak in a way that my words are simple and inserting light humor. Sometimes the audience won't react the way you expect them to. Especially in this situation where we come from different cultures and what I think might be amusing is serious for others.

The tricky part about talking about your country is that you are but one perspective. Others will not feel the same way as you. You must speak objectively and let it make clear what is fact and opinion.

I convinced Liliia to do this and I really hope that in the end she found it worth doing. It was definitely a different situation between her and me. She wants to talk about her country but she is also sensitive as to how people will react to her. This is a topic that she is not used to talking about in public. 

In an awkward situation I misjudged that it was okay to bring up to Koreans and Japanese how Filipinos do not feel hatred towards our former colonizers. And I know more than the average person why that is. I should have been more sensitive instead of trying to instigate conversation. Maybe it was for the better, maybe it is not. It was interesting for me to hear the Japanese side from Takuya. This week I have learned a valuable lesson about working in global environments that I haven't considered before.

## How not to dinner party

So my first dinner party was meh. And I think I know the culprit. Do not talk about terrorism and war right of the bat. I'm not sure if you should do that at all with people you are meeting for the first time. Do not go on and on about something. Yeah you know a lot of things and you can contribute in all topics, but you don't have to and you shouldn't. Damn! Zero self-awareness. Sorry for the hate post. But now I know who to avoid in dinner parties. Shit, hearing how fun all other dinner parties were makes me wonder how a dinner party can be so intense and serious.

## In other news

My hands shook again holding a piece of paper. Molly commented that I was still able to deliver a speech despite being nervous. I am not sure if it is nervousness at this point. But in the future, I must not violate a cardinal sin, do not bring a paper on stage. Memorize it.

## And now, the end is near

Or is it the beginning? ACE went by so fast. 이제 본게임의 시작. Let the games begin!
