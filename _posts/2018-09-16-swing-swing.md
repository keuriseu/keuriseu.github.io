This week I was stressing out that I miss out on some gatherings but I also realized that it's totally fine to miss out. Soyeon and Sean are my first priorities no matter what. We took a trip downtown, finally, after almost two months in Chicago. It was fun. There are so many museums we should go to while we're here. 

MORS has been great. I am learning quite a bit. Off the top of my head, here are some of the knowledge I retained. Humans are hypersensitive to violations of fairness. 12 Angry Men is a good movie. There are lots to learn about exercising influence for example in persuasion. 

The type of leader I want to be is someone who can use the power of words to influence people and solve societal issues.

A lot of things happen throughout the week. We're only getting started.
