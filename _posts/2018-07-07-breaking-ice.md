I delivered my farewell speech disguised as an ice breaker. It is amazing how everything came around the way it did. It did not take long for me to prepare for this speech which according to my personal evaluation, I delivered pretty well. It's sad to leave SOTM, knowing I could have done more. We could have reached more people. I'm proud of the journey I took to reach this point. 

This week although not in photos was the farewell from Facers. I appreciate their kind words. Again it's sad to leave Facers, without winning enough and knowing my team better. Who knows what we could have achieved this season. I wish them all the best. I look back at my first year as a bench player, and appreciate the strides I made with my game.

It has been tiring commuting to Ansan. Seeing this house makes me realize how important space is. I have stayed too long in small houses. Mother in law has been great, and so are Soyeon's other relatives. I wish I got to know them better.
