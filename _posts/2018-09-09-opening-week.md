The week has been overwhelming. Kellogg made this week so full of events and that might be the point. I like Kellogg's culture and people will definitely gain teamwork skills here.

## I don't like to talk about beers and sports

Lisha asked this question during the diversity talk and the supposed answer was that Americans and Internationals must come together in the middle. Yes we are in the US, it is the local culture but Kellogg must be inclusive to separate itself from others, for it to be the school that international students will feel safe and comfortable in.

## MORS gems

Classes have been amazing. These are not just some abstract touchy feely leadership classes but are instead data driven and very scientific. Some takeaways. Escalation of commitment is human nature than can be exploited for bad and for good. Group think could be dangerous and there are many horrors that humans are capable of doing due to this. Personal biases and emotions impact decisions greatly.

You need a lot of preparation in order to be very effective and have contribution to your team. I will improve on this throughout the year.

## Kwestie Besties

Juicy pointed this out that KWEST worked out after all. Even if you didn't necessarily enjoy the trip itself, these are a group of people that will have your backs. I enjoyed the CIM celebration party, which was surprising. You know enough people to have fun in a party setting now, and just dance. ACE is now a safe place and a core network of people you started this journey with.

## First time hosts

We hosted Soum and Mars for lunch which turned out really nice. Must do it more in the future.
