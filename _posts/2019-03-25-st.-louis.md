That was tiring. We just came back from St. Louis. It was a great trip. We had great food. We saw the great gateway arch. Amazing feat really. We enjoyed Six Flags. Great trip. But tiring. I want to go back to St. Louis at some point.

I had a migraine attack. I can feel stress these days. Not what you would expect from Spring break. Migraine patch worked really well.

Sean is so cute. I feel like he grew a lot in a span of days. He will be turning one next week. My little boy getting bigger.

One more week of break left.

It was long ago when I last rode a roller coaster. The Batman ride was awesome.
