Your comfort zone is a beautiful thing, but you will never grow there. Joseph Patton, a great speaker, talked to ACE about careers. One of the things that resonated with me is how it is okay to step out of your comfort zone. We just had another party and I was never good at parties. But go to enough parties and I will be comfortable in it. Parties are fun and a great way to enjoy and meet people. I will only grow when I challenge myself.

## Similarity Principle

I'm no stranger to being the odd man out. I remember being in a group for a study experience in Japan, I was the only guy. Not a great thing to happen to a socially awkward all-boys high school student. Being in Korea, I was always the only foreigner, or the only Filipino.

And this is a fact of life. ACE is basically Brazil, China, Korea, Japan. It is up to me to reach out and never the other way around. Gotta represent!

## The Horror

So government offices are not as efficient as Korea's. It's an epic waste of time calling DHS. I've heard similar situations in the DMV. The bad side on this side.

Things are starting to become awesome!

Shit I have lots of white hair!
